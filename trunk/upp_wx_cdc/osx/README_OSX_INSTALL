These instructions will allow you to build "usbpicprog" as a universal app.
That means PPC and Intel 32-bit. You can also build a Cocoa-version which
also is x86_64 compatible. OS X version compability is 10.5+

2. REQUIREMENTS

First of all you must have MacPorts installed. Google it if you don't know
what it is.

If you have OS X Snow Leopard installed, you will have to edit the MacPorts
configuration file to allow building for PPC. Standard installation, the 
file is located here:

/opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf

Find these lines, and add "ppc" to it!
# machine architectures
universal_archs         x86_64 i386

The result should look like this:
# machine architectures
universal_archs         x86_64 i386 ppc

Some standard ports are required to build this. I will name the ones I
remember from the top of my head, if something doesn't work read the error
messages and install anyhing that is missing.

NOTE: You must use the +universal flag whenever installing a port! Example:
To install wget, type:

sudo port install libtool +universal

Other ports that are necessary:

sudo port install wget 
sudo port install bash
sudo port install libtool +universal
sudo port install intltool +universal
sudo port install glib2 +universal
sudo port install libidn +universal
sudo port install libusb +universal
sudo port install zlib +universal
sudo port install libiconv +universal
sudo port install expat +universal

3. Howto install

Read README.txt (duh, I am!!)

Edit "settings" to match your preferences.

Install wxWidgets by running the script "install_wxWidgets.sh". This only
has to be done once! (Unless you change the settings file...)

Run the buildmac.sh script which will build "usbpicprog" twice and create
a universal app by combining the builds internally.

Run the create_disk_image.sh to create a disk image of the app.

All done!
