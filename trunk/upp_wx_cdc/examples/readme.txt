This folder contains some PIC projects provided as simple examples for starting your own PIC project
and/or to quickly test the UsbPicProgrammer against your PICs.

The projects can be easily adapted to different PIC models and both MPLAB (for Windows users) and Piklab
(for Linux users) project files are provided.

Happy hacking!
