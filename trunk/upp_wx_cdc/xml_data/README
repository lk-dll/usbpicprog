This folder contains the Piklab XML files used by UsbPicProg to store&load data about
many PIC devices.

Note that these files were taken from 
 http://piklab.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/piklab/trunk/piklab/src/devices/pic/xml_data/

The subset of the devices currently supported by UsbPicProg is stored into ../index.xml
